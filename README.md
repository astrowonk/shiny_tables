### Bootstrap tables from DataFrames

A very early rough implementation for Shiny of my [Dash Dataframe Tables package](https://github.com/astrowonk/dash_dataframe_table) for Shiny for Python. So far at least one odd bug with conditional formatting.

Demo app included! Run in the directory with `shiny run.` It's also [running live here](https://marcoshuerta.com/shiny/shiny_tables/), though I need to put in some code blocks, etc.
